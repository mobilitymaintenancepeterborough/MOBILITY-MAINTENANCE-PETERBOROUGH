<h2>Who Are We?</h2>
</header>
<p>
My name is David and I am the owner of Mobility Maintenance Peterborough and my company has over 15 years experience in maintaining and repairing a wide range of mobility scooters in Peterborough and the surrounding area.
</p>
<p>
I'm often asked "why mobility scooter repairs" and "How can we be so competitive?" 
</p>
<p>
We understand how important it is to be able to rely on your mobility scooter and the independence they can provide.   We will always do our best to <strong>"Keep You Moving"</strong> and we take pride in our work and take the time to understand the needs of every customer.
</p>
<p> 
Our prices are competative as we are a small team, which means we can offer a consitent, reliable service and treat each customer as an individual.  We don't have the overheads of running a shop, we undertake repairs at our workshop and prefer to make a small profit and have satisfied customers, many of which use our services time after time. It really is as simple as that.  
</p>
<p>
Our aim is to provide a fast, friendly, reliable and competative service.  We have a genuine interest in the needs of our customers and will go the extra mile to ensure customer satisfaction.  For your convenience, where possible, we will come to your premises to undertake the service / repair.  On occasions this will not be possible, in which case we will take your mobility scooter away to our workshop and return it to you once fixed/serviced and an agreed date and time.

<h3>Previous repairs</h3>
<p>
I love learning new technology and then showing other people what is out there and how it might help them, be it a new gadget or a framework.
At my current work place I've done a number of 'lunchtime learning' and bite size info sessions teaching the basics of some of the things I've learnt.
